## Topic
- .map() transformation method in Java

## Why is it important
- lambda/functional/reactive/event-driven/async programming is modern and useful
- As a replacement of loops, it provides better readability

## How do we define success for today's lesson
- You should be able to perform basic data transformations using Stream.map() in Java.

## Java Streams
- A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations
- A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never modifies the underlying data source.

## Demos
- Declarative instead of imperative //print
- map() produces a new stream after applying a function to each element of the original stream. //map
- filter() produces a new stream that contains elements of the original stream that pass a predicate //filterAndMap
- More...

## What's the catch
- Performance overhead
- Dramatically different to imperative style coding

## Bonus
- extraCredit
