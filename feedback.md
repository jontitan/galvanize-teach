# Feedback from first practice teach

## Good
- Able to set a clear goal and objective of the lesson
- Preparation of GitHub repo and sample code
- Stayed patient and positive on the interruptions
- Had good speech cadence and easy to follow 

## Meh
- Prepared way too much material to be covered just in 30 minutes
    - Action Item: Shorten the lesson
- Spent too much time answering an individual student's question
    - Action Item: Check if the whole class has the same question before proceeding

## Room for Improvement
- Made assumptions of students' fundamental knowledge without verifying which lead to a lot of time wasted off topic
    - Action Item: Do a quick baseline knowledge check before jumping into the topic
- A little too married to the prepared demo code
    - Action Item: Be comfortable changing the demo code on the fly
- Too vague when checking for understanding. (Only asked "Are we good?")
    - Action Item: Ask more specific questions, don't be afraid to call out students
- The coding example might be unnecessarily complex
    - Action Item: Removed the TDD aspect of the code
- GitHub repo is hard to clone and set up while trying to follow the lesson
    - Action Item: Moved the demo to an online java editor
